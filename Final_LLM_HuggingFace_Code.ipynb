It was trained using the same data sources as phi-1, augmented with a new data source that consists of various NLP synthetic texts. When assessed against benchmarks testing common sense, language understanding, and logical reasoning, phi-1.5 demonstrates a nearly state-of-the-art performance among models with less than 10 billion parameters."

The process used to make a Camembert will be similar to, but not quite the same as, that used to make Cheddar.\\n\\nSome cheeses may be deliberately left to ferment from naturally airborne spores and bacteria; this approach generally leads to a less consistent product but one that is valuable in a niche market.\\n\\nCulturing\\nCheese is made by bringing milk (possibly pasteurised) in the cheese vat to a temperature required to promote the growth of the bacteria that feed on lactose and thus ferment the lactose into lactic acid.

It's good for people with asthma because it helps your lungs get stronger. Aerobic exercise can also help you lose weight, which can help you breathe easier. Aerobic exercise can include: Running Walking Swimming Cycling Aerobics Dancing Aerobics Yoga Aerobics Aerobics Aerobics Aerobics\n",

      "How is obsessive-compulsive disorder diagnosed? Answer: Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and your family history. You may also be asked to fill out a questionnaire. Your doctor may also order a blood test to check for a chemical imbalance in your brain. Your doctor may also order a brain scan, such as an MRI or CT scan, to check for any structural problems in your brain. Your doctor may also order a psychological evaluation to check for any underlying mental health issues. Your doctor may\n",
